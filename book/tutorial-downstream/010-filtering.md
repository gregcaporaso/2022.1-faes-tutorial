We'll next obtain a much larger feature table representing all of the samples
included in the ({cite}`liao-data-2021`) dataset. These would take too much
time to denoise in this course, so we'll start with the feature table,
sequences, and metadata provided by the authors and filter to samples that
we'll use for our analyses. If you'd like to perform other experiments with
this feature table, you can do that using the full feature table or a subset
that you define by filtering.

## Access the data

First, download the full feature table.

```{usage}
feature_table_url = 'https://data.qiime2.org/2022.2/tutorials/liao/full-feature-table.qza'

def artifact_from_url(url):
    def factory():
        import tempfile
        import requests
        import qiime2

        data = requests.get(url)

        with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as f:
            f.write(data.content)
            f.flush()
            result = qiime2.Artifact.load(f.name)

        return result
    return factory

feature_table = use.init_artifact(
        'feature-table',
        artifact_from_url(feature_table_url))
```

Next, download the ASV sequences.

```{usage}
seqs_url = 'https://data.qiime2.org/2022.2/tutorials/liao/rep-seqs.qza'

feature_sequences = use.init_artifact(
    'rep-seqs',
    artifact_from_url(seqs_url))
```

Finally, download the metadata.

```{usage}
def partial_metadata_factory():
    ## This function is identical to the filter.md metadata_factory function - should
    ## be able to call that once issue#1 is addressed.
    import tempfile
    import requests
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np

    import qiime2

    sample_metadata_url = 'https://data.qiime2.org/2022.2/tutorials/liao/sample-metadata.tsv'
    data = requests.get(sample_metadata_url)
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as f:
        f.write(data.content)
        sample_metadata = pd.read_csv(f.name, index_col='SampleID', sep='\t')
    patient_sample_counts = sample_metadata['PatientID'].value_counts()
    sample_metadata['patient-sample-counts'] = \
        patient_sample_counts[sample_metadata['PatientID']].values


    transplant_metadata_url = 'https://data.qiime2.org/2022.2/tutorials/liao/transplant-metadata.tsv'
    data = requests.get(transplant_metadata_url)
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as f:
        f.write(data.content)
        transplant_metadata = pd.read_csv(f.name, sep='\t')
    # If a patient received multiple HCTs, keep data only on the most recent.
    # This is useful for simplifying downstream workflows.
    transplant_metadata = transplant_metadata.sort_values('TimepointOfTransplant')
    most_recent_transplant_metadata = transplant_metadata.drop_duplicates(subset=['PatientID'], keep='last')
    most_recent_transplant_metadata = most_recent_transplant_metadata.set_index('PatientID')


    autoFmtControlIds = {'C%d' % i for i in range(1,12)}
    autoFmtTreatmentIds = {'T%d' % i for i in range(1,15)}
    new_column = {}
    for ptid, aptid in most_recent_transplant_metadata['autoFmtPatientId'].items():
        if aptid in autoFmtControlIds:
            value = 'control'
        elif aptid in autoFmtTreatmentIds:
            value = 'treatment'
        else:
            value = np.nan
        new_column[ptid] = value
    most_recent_transplant_metadata['autoFmtGroup'] = pd.Series(new_column)

    sample_metadata = sample_metadata.join(most_recent_transplant_metadata, on='PatientID')

    sample_metadata['categorical-time-relative-to-hct'] = \
        pd.cut(sample_metadata['DayRelativeToNearestHCT'],
               [-1000, -1, 5, 1000],
               labels=['pre', 'peri', 'post'])

    sample_metadata['week-relative-to-hct'] = \
        pd.cut(sample_metadata['DayRelativeToNearestHCT'],
               [-1000, -14, -7, 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 1000],
               labels=[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

    sample_metadata = sample_metadata.astype(
            {'categorical-time-relative-to-hct': object,
             'week-relative-to-hct': float})

    return qiime2.Metadata(sample_metadata)

def fmt_metadata_factory():
    # obtain the metadata that we've been using so far
    sample_metadata = partial_metadata_factory().to_dataframe()

    # obtain the autoFMT-specific metadata
    import tempfile
    import requests
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np

    import qiime2

    fmt_metadata_url = 'https://data.qiime2.org/2022.2/tutorials/liao/fmt-metadata.tsv'
    data = requests.get(fmt_metadata_url)
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as f:
        f.write(data.content)
        f.flush()
        fmt_metadata = pd.read_csv(f.name, sep='\t')
    fmt_metadata = fmt_metadata.set_index('PatientID')

    # join the two metadata collections, dropping duplicate columns
    sample_metadata = sample_metadata.join(fmt_metadata.drop(['autoFmtPatientId'], axis=1), on='PatientID')

    # Create new column relating all samples to day relative to FMT treatment.
    # For patients in the "control" group, this will be the day they were
    # assigned to that group, which is when they would have received the FMT
    # (or one to two days before that) if they had been assigned to the
    # "treatment" group.
    fmt_day = sample_metadata['FMTDayRelativeToNearestHCT'].fillna(
                sample_metadata['RandomizationDayRelativeToNearestHCT'])
    day_relative_to_fmt = sample_metadata['DayRelativeToNearestHCT'] - fmt_day
    sample_metadata.insert(0, 'day-relative-to-fmt', day_relative_to_fmt, True)

    sample_metadata['week-relative-to-fmt'] = \
        pd.cut(sample_metadata['day-relative-to-fmt'],
               [-1000, -14, -7, 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 1000],
               labels=[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

    sample_metadata['categorical-time-relative-to-fmt'] = \
        pd.cut(sample_metadata['day-relative-to-fmt'],
               [-1000, -1, 5, 1000],
               labels=['pre', 'peri', 'post'])

    sample_metadata = sample_metadata.astype(
            {'categorical-time-relative-to-fmt': object,
             'week-relative-to-fmt': float})

    return qiime2.Metadata(sample_metadata)

sample_metadata = use.init_metadata('sample_metadata', fmt_metadata_factory)
```

## View the metadata

It's a good idea to get a view of the study metadata as QIIME 2 sees it. This
will allow you to assess whether the metadata that QIIME 2 is using is as you
expect. You can do this using the `tabulate` action in QIIME 2's `q2-metadata`
plugin as follows.

```{usage}
use.action(
    use.UsageAction(plugin_id='metadata', action_id='tabulate'),
    use.UsageInputs(input=sample_metadata),
    use.UsageOutputNames(visualization='metadata_summ')
)
```

## Generate summaries of full table and sequence data

Next, it's useful to generate summaries of the feature table and sequence data.
We did this after running DADA2 previously, but since we're now working with a
new feature table and new sequence data, we should look at a summary of this
table as well.

```{usage}
use.action(
    use.UsageAction(plugin_id='feature_table', action_id='summarize'),
    use.UsageInputs(table=feature_table, sample_metadata=sample_metadata),
    use.UsageOutputNames(visualization='table'),
)

use.action(
    use.UsageAction(plugin_id='feature_table', action_id='tabulate_seqs'),
    use.UsageInputs(data=feature_sequences),
    use.UsageOutputNames(visualization='rep_seqs'),
)
```

```{admonition} Which column or columns in the metadata could be used to
:class: question, dropdown
identify samples that were included in the autoFMT study?

Several columns contain this information, such as autoFmtGroup which contains
the value "treatment" if the subject was in the treatment group, "control" if
the subject was in the control group, and no value if the patient was not
enrolled in this particular study.
```


## Filter the feature table to the autoFMT study samples

In this tutorial, we're going to work specifically with samples that were
included in the autoFMT randomized trial. We'll now begin a series of filtering
steps applied to both the feature table and the sequences to select only
features and samples that are relevant to that study.

First, we'll remove samples that are not part of the autoFMT study from the
feature table. We identify these samples using the metadata: specifically,
samples that do not contain a value in the autoFmtGroup column in the metadata
are filtered with this step.

```{usage}
autofmt_table, = use.action(
    use.UsageAction(plugin_id='feature_table', action_id='filter_samples'),
    use.UsageInputs(table=feature_table, metadata=sample_metadata,
                    where="autoFmtGroup IS NOT NULL"),
    use.UsageOutputNames(filtered_table='autofmt_table')
)
```

We can now summarize the feature table again to observe how it changed as a
result of this filtering.

```{usage}
use.action(
    use.UsageAction(plugin_id='feature_table', action_id='summarize'),
    use.UsageInputs(table=autofmt_table, sample_metadata=sample_metadata),
    use.UsageOutputNames(visualization='autofmt_table_summ'),
)
```

```{admonition} How many samples and features are in this feature table after
filtering? How does that compare to the feature table prior to filtering?
:class: question, dropdown
**TODO**: Fill this in!
```

## Perform additional filtering steps on feature table

Before we proceed with the analysis, we'll apply a few more filtering steps.
First, we'll drop samples that are not included in the metadata.

**TODO**: Is this step still needed? I think the autoFmtGroup filter will
achieve the same outcome.

```{usage}
filtered_table_1, = use.action(
    use.UsageAction(plugin_id='feature_table', action_id='filter_samples'),
    use.UsageInputs(table=autofmt_table, metadata=sample_metadata),
    use.UsageOutputNames(filtered_table='filtered_table_1')
    )
```

Next, we're going to focus in on a specific window of timely - mainly the
period of ten days prior to the patients cell transplant through seventy days
following the transplant. Some of the subjects in this study have very long
term microbiota data, but since many don't it helps to just focus our analysis
on the temporal range that is most relevant to this analysis.

```{usage}
filtered_table_2, = use.action(
    use.UsageAction(plugin_id='feature_table', action_id='filter_samples'),
    use.UsageInputs(table=filtered_table_1, metadata=sample_metadata,
                    where="DayRelativeToNearestHCT BETWEEN -10 AND 70"),
    use.UsageOutputNames(filtered_table='filtered_table_2')
)
```

Finally, we'll filter features from the feature table if they don't occur in at
least two samples. This filter is used here primarily to reduce the runtime of
some of the downstream steps for the purpose of this tutorial. This filter
isn't necessary to run in your own analyses.


```{usage}
filtered_table_3, = use.action(
    use.UsageAction(plugin_id='feature_table', action_id='filter_features'),
    use.UsageInputs(table=filtered_table_2, min_samples=2),
    use.UsageOutputNames(filtered_table='filtered_table_3')
    )
```

We can then generate and review another feature table summary.

```{usage}
use.action(
    use.UsageAction(plugin_id='feature_table', action_id='summarize'),
    use.UsageInputs(table=filtered_table_3, sample_metadata=sample_metadata),
    use.UsageOutputNames(visualization='filtered_table_3_summ'),
)
```

```{admonition} How many samples and features are in the feature table after
this latest filtering? How does that compare to the prior feature tables?
:class: question, dropdown

**TODO**: Fill this in!
```

## Filter features from sequence data to reduce runtime of feature annotation

At this point, we have filtered features from our feature table, but those
features are still present in our sequence data. In the next section we'll be
performing some computationally expensive operations on these sequences, so to
make those go quicker we'll next filter all features that are no longer in our
feature table from our collection of feature sequences.

```{usage}
filtered_sequences_1, = use.action(
    use.UsageAction(plugin_id='feature_table', action_id='filter_seqs'),
    use.UsageInputs(data=feature_sequences, table=filtered_table_3),
    use.UsageOutputNames(filtered_data='filtered_sequences_1')
    )
```

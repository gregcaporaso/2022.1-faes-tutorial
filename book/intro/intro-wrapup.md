# Getting Started

## Getting started

Ok, that's enough discussion about QIIME 2 for now. It's time to start using it. Don't worry if you feel like you don't fully understand some of the technical details I covered in this chapter right now. My goal was to introduce these ideas to you here, and we'll revisit them in the remaining chapters in the book. As we contextualize these ideas by using QIIME 2, they'll become clearer.

# Hematopoietic cell transplantation data

This tutorial focuses on data reused from [Liao et al (2021) _Compilation of
longitudinal microbiota data and hospitalome from hematopoietic cell
transplantation patients_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00860-8)
({cite:t}`liao-data-2021`).

We thank the study participants for the contribution of their valuable samples
while undergoing cancer treatment, and we thank {cite:t}`liao-data-2021` for
their considerable efforts to make this data set accessible to the cancer
microbiome research community.

Any work that uses this data should cite {cite:t}`liao-data-2021`
 **and** the original studies (which are all cited in
 {cite:t}`liao-data-2021`).

 **TODO** fill in relevant references for the original studies that we focus on
 in this tutorial.

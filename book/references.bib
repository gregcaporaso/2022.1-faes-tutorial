              several factors including its composition, drug administrations,
              therapeutic interventions and underlying diseases. Unfortunately,
              many human microbiota datasets available publicly were collected
              to study the impact of single variables, and typically consist of
              outpatients in cross-sectional studies, have small sample numbers
              and/or lack metadata to account for confounders. These
              limitations can complicate reusing the data for questions outside
              their original focus. Here, we provide comprehensive longitudinal
              patient dataset that overcomes those limitations: a collection of
              fecal microbiota compositions (>10,000 microbiota samples from
              >1,000 patients) and a rich description of the ``hospitalome''

              allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) at a

              date, the most commonly used method for dimensionality reduction

              differences (beta diversity), followed by principal-coordinate

              secondary variables. RESULTS: Here we present Krona, a new
              visualization tool that allows intuitive exploration of relative
              abundances and confidences within the complex hierarchies of
              metagenomic classifications. Krona combines a variant of radial,
              space-filling displays with parametric coloring and interactive
              polar-coordinate zooming. The HTML5 and JavaScript implementation
              enables fully interactive charts that can be explored with any
              modern Web browser, without the need for installed software or
              plug-ins. This Web-based architecture also allows each chart to
              be an independent document, making them easy to share via e-mail
              or post to a standard Web server. To illustrate Krona's utility,
              we describe its application to various metagenomic data sets and
              its compatibility with popular metagenomic analysis tools.
              CONCLUSIONS: Krona is both a powerful metagenomic visualization
              tool and a demonstration of the potential of HTML5 for highly
              accessible bioinformatic visualizations. Its rich and interactive
              displays facilitate more informed interpretations of metagenomic
              analyses, while its implementation as a browser-based application
              makes it extremely portable and easily adopted into existing
              analysis packages. Both the Krona rendering code and conversion
              tools are freely available under a BSD open-source license, and
              available from: http://krona.sourceforge.net.",

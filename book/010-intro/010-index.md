# Getting started with using QIIME 2

This section of the book will briefly introduce a few concepts that will be
helpful to understand as you start using QIIME 2. We'll cover all of the ideas
in this section during the workshop, but we think it's also worth reading these
sections on your own to solidify some of the core concepts and terminology of
QIIME 2.

It's not essential to have a complete grasp of all of the ideas in this
section to use QIIME 2. But the more of this that you know, the more QIIME 2
will make sense to you, and the more benefit you'll get out of learning and
using the system.

Please pose any questions you have for the open question and answer sessions at
the end of each day!

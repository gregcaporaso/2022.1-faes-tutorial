# Hematopoietic cell transplantation data

This folder contains experiments with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)
microbiome data reused from [Liao et al (2021) _Compilation of longitudinal
microbiota data and hospitalome from hematopoietic cell transplantation
patients_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00860-8)
({cite:t}`liao-data-2021`). We thank the authors for their considerable efforts
to make this valuable data set accessible to the cancer microbiome research
community. Any work that uses this data should cite {cite:t}`liao-data-2021`
**and** the original studies (which are all cited in {cite:t}`liao-data-2021`).
